# HarvestableMonsterCharacterEntity
Harvest items from monsters. (For MMORPG Kit)

Addon for [MMORPG Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/mmorpg-kit-2d-3d-survival-110188).

The primary use case for this would be if you want a player to be able to hack wood off of a tree monster or some similar situation.

### Setup

Replace MonsterCharacterEntity with this script on any Monster that you want to harvest resources from. Then create a Harvestable for it and apply that to the HarvestableMonsterCharacterEntity.
